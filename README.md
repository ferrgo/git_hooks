# Hooks for Git

## Commit-Msg
See [aradi/git-commit-msg-hook](https://gist.github.com/aradi/a651ee97cc6bd09acb237794a05eaa7f)
See [Sailr](https://github.com/craicoverflow/sailr)
See [Convetional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
See [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

Let the `commit-msg.conf.json` in your project folder and make it reflect your Standards, copy or symlink the `commit-msg` script to your `project/path/.git/hooks/` folder. 

PS: May be necessary to make it executable as `chmod +x project/path/.git/hooks/commit-msg`
